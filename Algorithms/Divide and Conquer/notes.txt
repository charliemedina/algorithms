The Divide and Conquer Paradigm 

1- DIVIDE the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the
same problem.

2- CONQUER the subproblems by solving them recursively. If the subproblem sizes are
small enough, however, just solve the subproblems in a straightforward manner.

3- COMBINE the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem.
